# OurGame Whitepaper

## Overview

According to Newzoo's "2021 Global Game Market Report", in 2021, the total number of global game players will exceed 3 billion, and game revenue will reach total $175.8 billion. Newzoo believes that by 2024, game players are expected to reach 3.32 billion, and global game revenue will reach 218.7 billion US dollars. With the wide application of blockchain technology, GameFi, which integrates DeFi, NFT, and games, will make a strong effort in 2021. According to DappRadar statistics, on April 18, 2021, the number of transactions in the chain game sector reached 480.7 billion US dollars. The number of players and users of blockchain games has also gradually increased. As of July 31, it exceeded 780,000, an increase of more than 170 times compared to the beginning of the year.

GameFi refers to presenting decentralized financial products in the form of games, gamifying the rules of DeFi, and transforming game prop derivatives into NFT. And is GameFi just DeFi+NFT+Game? At present, the mainstream GameFi is more about the interaction between projects and users. Although compared with traditional DeFi products, it enhances the sense of fun and immersion, but in the end, it is still human-computer interaction and numerical accumulation. The user was introduced into the project by the concept of "play-to-earn", but it evolved into "earn-to-play" in the process of the game. In the process of playing the game alone for a long time, the user lost the immersion and fun of the game.

"It's never the game that matters, it's who you play with." Social networking and games are known as the eternal needs of contemporary youth. The traditional GameFi and Social platforms convert the content contributed by users into their own profits, but users who spend a lot of time and energy cannot get direct rewards themselves. The combination of social and gaming is the best help. Under the core of GameFi, the social attribute is introduced. In this mode, every user can gain benefits by demonstrating their own value. Users become direct beneficiaries, and the time and energy they spend can get equivalent incentives.
