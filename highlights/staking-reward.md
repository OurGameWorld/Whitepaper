# Staking reward

The Great World of OurGame consists of a main city area and several sub-city areas, each of which has its own tax revenue. These taxes will be in the form of equity. Users subscribe to these stakes by staking $OGT to receive these tax incentives.

## **Staking/Equity Subscription Rules**

* Every user can participate in the subscription of shares. Initially, OurGame will set the starting price of the shares according to the algorithm, and users will decide the final price of the shares through bidding;
* Users subscribe a certain amount of equity by staking $OGT equal to the equity price, and the pledge period is 1 month;
* During the period that users own the equity, they will receive the tax revenue brought by each urban area every day. When the staking period expires, OurGame will return the $OGT to the user and recover the equity
