## **Basic introduction**

* **Land**: The parcel of land in the territory, the user acquires the right to use the land by spending $OGT. Each type of land corresponds to a type of mine;
* **Mine**: Users can build a mine on the land. After the construction is completed, there will be a certain amount of $TT in the mine. Different types of mines contain different amounts of $TT**;**
* **Mining license**: An important document for building a mine on the land;
* **Mining tools**: Players need corresponding mining tools to mine mines, which are obtained through synthesis

## **Territory planning**

Currently, OurGame plans for the territory as follows:

Mine construction consumption and initial $TT production are as follows

|   **MINE TYPE**   | **CONSTRUCTION CONSUMPTION** | **INITIAL OUTPUT($TT)** |
| :---------------: | :--------------------------: | :---------------------: |
|    primary mine   |      Mining license × 1      |          50,000         |
| Intermediate mine |      Mining license × 3      |         120,000         |
|    Premium mine   |      Mining license × 9      |         270,000         |

## **Mining and Profits**

* After the construction of the mine is completed, the user obtains the $TT income in the mine through mining;
* Each user can mine 360 ​​times a day (including the number of times of mining in other players' territories), and the number of times that has not been mined will not be accumulated and will be reset the next day;
* Before mining, users need to wear the corresponding mining tools. After successful mining, the durability of the mining tool will be consumed;
* Each mining will get 5‰ of the mine resources;
* If the player mines his own mine, he will get 100% of the income, which is 5‰ of the mine's resources;
* If the player mines another player's mine, then he will get 50% of the income, which is 2.5‰ of the mine's resources, and the owner of the mine will get another 50% of the income;
* Below are the mining rules for different types of mines:

|   **MINE TYPE**   | **MINING TOOLS** | **MINING TIMES/24 HOURS** | **RESOURCE PRODU CTION TIME** |
| :---------------: | :--------------: | :-----------------------: | :---------------------------: |
|    primary mine   |        hoe       |             24            |        15 minutes/time        |
| Intermediate mine |      wrench      |             24            |        15 minutes/time        |

## **Resource return**

The $TT in OurGame is continuously reflowed, and all users can get these reflow benefits

* The return of $TT comes from various systems in the OurGame world
* All mines that have been developed will participate in the return flow calculation, and the return income will be distributed to each mine that has been developed;
