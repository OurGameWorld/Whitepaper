# OurGame core elements

## NFT assets and application scenarios are defined by user Social behavior and Game behavior

* The user's Game behavior will directly define the basic value and added value of NFT;
* Based on the Soical behavior of users, the application scenarios of NFTs are extensive and flexible.

## OurGame Strategic Roadmap

* In the early stage, create a high-quality game environment, and gradually unlock a variety of social systems and NFT application scenarios, such as PvE, competition, and kingdom, for the purpose of initially building a game ecosystem;
* Subsequently, new game modules and gameplay will be voted on by the community; at the same time, we will define material production standards, open developer SDKs and API interfaces, and allow the majority of creators to participate in game creation.

## The underlying economy is powered by a sustainable dual-token economic system

* Our Game Token ($OGT): The system token of the OurGame world, the governance token for stakeholders to share resources
* Tomorrow Token($TT): The native utility token of the OurGame world
