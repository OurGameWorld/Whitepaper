# OurGame Core Values

* Unbalanced state: We hope that in the three dimensions of role, space and time, what each user pursues and obtains are unbalanced, so as to promote social behavior among users;
* High degree of freedom: From the perspective of the "creator", we create the most primitive game ecological environment for users, and give the power to construct complex systems and ultra-complex systems to every user in the ecosystem.
* Distributed/Decentralized: Based on each user's Social behavior and Game behavior, the game ecology can be arranged, combined, changed, conflicted, related, and functioned at any time.
