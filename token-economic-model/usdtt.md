# $TT

## Introduction

TT tokens are the in-game currency. Its distribution is unlimited, but the balance between its production and consumption is the premise of OurGame game design, because its stability is the cornerstone of the entire OurGame game world.

## Release

Players earn $TT through game actions.

## Consumption and Return

* For each transaction in the in-game market, OurGame will charge 2% of the transaction amount as a handling fee. Part of these costs are used for the daily expenses of game operation (server costs, maintenance costs), and another portion will go into the special event prize pool in the game, which will be distributed to the players participating in the event as a bonus;
* Part of the $TT spent by players in various systems will be returned to the territory mining pool
